#
# the text parser works by tokenizing each word and evaluating if the
# word is one of the following: url, ipv4, ipv4, fqdn, email, hash, binary
#
# text matching should almost always be a low conficence as google.com would
# certainly match as a fqdn
parser: text

# values within default apply to all feeds
defaults:

  # provider: short name of the source, normally the fqdn of the source URL
  provider: blog.example.com

  # altid_tlp: traffic light protocol (TLP) of the alternet id

  # tlp: traffic light protocol (TLP) of the observable
  #   (red, amber, green, white)
  tlp: green

  # confidence: confidence in the observable (65,75,85,95)

  # tags: tag(s) describing the data (https://goo.gl/OCK8yc)

  # store_content: do you want to store the text line as "additional data"
